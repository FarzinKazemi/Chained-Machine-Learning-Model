# Chained-Machine-Learning-Model
This repository created for the paper "Chained machine learning model for predicting load capacity and ductility of steel fiber-reinforced concrete beams" to allow readers to find the codes and dataset of the paper.

# How to Run the code?
To run the codes, first be sure about the updated version of Python, then, check the dataset that should be in same folder. The Chained ML model, Paralel model, and Multi-output ANNs are uplouded and can be run to have their results.
The related paper will be added soon for the interest of readers.
